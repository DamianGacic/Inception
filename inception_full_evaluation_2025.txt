‚ùå NOT TESTED: HTTP port 80 blocking verification
‚ùå NOT TESTED: HTTPS access to damian.42.fr

SSL Configuration Found:
- Self-signed certificate generation present

========================================
WORDPRESS WITH PHP-FPM AND VOLUME
========================================

‚úÖ PASS: wordpress/Dockerfile exists and builds successfully
‚úÖ PASS: No NGINX in WordPress Dockerfile (only PHP-FPM)
‚úÖ PASS: Volume exists and configured correctly

üîÑ ISSUE: WordPress installation conflicts with existing config files

Volume Configuration:
- Volume name: wordpress
- Driver: local with bind mount
- Host path: /home/damian/data/wordpress
- Container path: /var/www/wordpress

WordPress Setup Issues:
- "wp-config.php file already exists" error

‚úÖ PASS: Volume mountpoint contains correct path (/home/damian/data/)
‚ùå NOT TESTED: Database functionality (container startup issues)

Volume Configuration:
- Volume name: mariadb
- Driver: local with bind mount
- Host path: /home/damian/data/mariadb
- Container path: /var/lib/mysql

Database Configuration:
- Database name: wordpress
- User: wp_user
- Root password configured via environment variables

Requirements still to test:
- Database login functionality
- Database content verification
- WordPress-MariaDB connectivity

========================================
PERSISTENCE TEST
========================================

‚ùå NOT TESTED: Cannot test persistence due to container startup issues

Requirements for persistence test:
1. Successfully start all containers
2. Make changes to WordPress site
3. Restart containers
4. Verify changes persist

========================================
ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXES APPLIED
========================================

FIXES APPLIED:
1. ‚úÖ WordPress Dockerfile typo: ENTRYPOINt ‚Üí ENTRYPOINT
2. ‚úÖ Admin username: admin ‚Üí wpowner (compliance achieved)
3. ‚úÖ Docker image naming: removed version tags
4. ‚úÖ WordPress title quoting: added proper quotes for "My WordPress Site"
5. ‚úÖ WordPress CLI parameters: added proper quoting
6. ‚úÖ Missing secrets directory: created structure

REMAINING ISSUES:
1. üîÑ WordPress config file conflicts (wp-config.php already exists)
2. ‚ùå Container startup hangs due to WordPress installation issues
3. ‚ùå Need timeout mechanisms for reliable testing

========================================
ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
========================================

‚úÖ Domain: damian.42.fr (correctly configured)
‚úÖ Environment variables: properly defined in .env
‚úÖ Passwords: not exposed in Dockerfiles
‚úÖ Volume paths: correctly mapped to /home/damian/data/

Environment Variables Status:
- DB_NAME: wordpress ‚úÖ
- DB_USER: wp_user ‚úÖ
- WP_ADMIN: wpowner ‚úÖ (compliant)

EVALUATION SUMMARY
========================================

COMPLIANCE STATUS:
‚úÖ PASSED: 18 requirements
üîÑ PARTIAL: 3 requirements (containers start but have issues)
‚ùå NOT TESTED: 7 requirements (due to runtime issues)

OVERALL PROJECT STATUS: SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BUT NEEDS RUNTIME FIXES

Strengths:
- Excellent Docker and network configuration
- Proper security practices (no exposed credentials)
- Correct directory structure and file organization
- All builds complete successfully
- Compliance with naming and base image requirements

Areas needing attention:
- WordPress installation process needs improvement
- Container startup reliability
- Runtime functionality testing

RECOMMENDATION:
Project structure and build process are solid. Focus on fixing WordPress
installation conflicts to enable full functionality testing. With runtime
issues resolved, this project would likely pass evaluation.

Next Steps:
1. Fix WordPress config file cleanup
2. Test full container startup
3. Verify SSL/TLS functionality
4. Test WordPress and database connectivity
5. Verify persistence after restart
